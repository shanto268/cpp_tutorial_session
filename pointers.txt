A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable. Like any variable or constant, you must declare a pointer before you can work with it. The general form of a pointer variable declaration is âˆ’
    type *var-name;

Address of operator (&)

Declaring pointers (we use a star) :

int * number;
char * character;
double * decimals;

Pointer Initialization:

int myvar;
int * myptr = &myvar;
